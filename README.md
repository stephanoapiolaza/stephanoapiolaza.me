## Get Started
You must install node.js, the next step is download dev dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```
Now, install gulp:
```js
npm install gulp-cli-g

```
Finally, you must run the main gulp task to make the production folder:

## You think you've found a bug?
Oh, I am ashamed and want to fix it ASAP! But before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. 
In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using [http://plnkr.co](http://plnkr.co). 
Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:

* version of Angular used
* version of this library that you are using
* 3rd-party libraries used, if any
* and most importantly - a use-case that fails

A minimal reproduce scenario using [http://plnkr.co/](http://plnkr.co/) allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem. The best part is that you do not need to create plunks from scratch - you can fork one from me [website](http://stephanoapiolaza.me).

We will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal plunk. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduce scenario using [http://plnkr.co](http://plnkr.co), so if we don't hear back from you we are going to close an issue that don't have enough info to be reproduced.
